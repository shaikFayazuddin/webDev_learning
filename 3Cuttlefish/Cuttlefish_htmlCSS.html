    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <a href="#nowhere">Cuttlefish</a>  or cuttles are <a href="#empty">marine</a>  molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for
        control of buoyancy.Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which
        they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm , with the largest species, the giant
        cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg  in mass

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2
        years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.Cuttlefish also have
        one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates

        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with the Old
        Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source
        of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and
        Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).They have an unusual
        biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean,
        as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time the family evolved,
        ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to
        cross

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Visual system
    </h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod
        eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.Superficial similarities between cephalopod and
        vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving
        W-shape.Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances
        their perception of contrast.

    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
        
        The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin
        to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The blood is pumped
        by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and
        the third pumps blood around the rest of the body.

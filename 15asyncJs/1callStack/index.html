    <h1>Call Stack</h1>
    <p>Go to console and then to Sources, mark the line to add a breakpoint and refresh and then run the code.
    Look at the call stack in source tab to see how the code is getting executed
    </p>
    <h2>More about Call Stack</h2>
    <p>
        The Mechanism the JS interpreter uses to keep track of its place in a script that cals multiple functions.

        How JS knows what function is curretly being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>How IT works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When a script calls a fucntion, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the fucntion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack furter up, and run where teir calls are reached.
        </li>
        <li>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing</li>
    </ul>
